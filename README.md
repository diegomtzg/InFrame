CMU ECE Capstone Project | Spring 2020

InFrame is an intelligent, motorized photography assistant that uses state of the art object detection models and tracking algorithms to follow user-selected targets across a 3D space, constantly keeping them InFrame.

## Overview
* Target selection on client iOS app triggers object detection on system and bounding boxes are displayed on screen.
* Once a target is selected, the bounding box ID is sent to the system to begin recording and tracking, keeping target InFrame.
